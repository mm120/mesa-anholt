                             Month day, 2004

                              PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 6.1) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 6.0) designate stable releases.


New Features
------------

TBD



Driver / context changes
------------------------

The _mesa_create_context() and _mesa_initialize_context() function
parameters have changed.  They now take a pointer to a struct
dd_function_table.  Drivers can initialize this table by calling
_mesa_init_driver_functions().  Drivers should then plug in the special
functions they implement.  In particular, the ctx->Driver.NewTextureObject
pointer _must_ be set so that the default texture objects created in
_mesa_create/initialize_context() are correctly built.

The _mesa_init_driver_functions() function allows a lot of redundant code
to be removed from the device drivers (such as initializing
ctx->Driver.Accum to point to _swrast_Accum).  Adding new functions to
the dd_function_table can be done with less hassle since the pointer can
be initialized in _mesa_init_driver_functions() rather than in _all_ the
drivers.





Device Drivers
--------------

Mesa advertises itself as either OpenGL 1.2 or OpenGL 1.3 depending on
the device driver.  For example, if the driver enables all the ARB
extensions which are part of OpenGL 1.3 then glGetString(GL_VERSION)
will return "1.3".  Otherwise, it'll return "1.2".

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of the drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:


Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.5
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.5
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.5
DJGPP			implements OpenGL 1.5
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			implements OpenGL 1.5
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating
