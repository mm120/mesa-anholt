Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

The internal structure of Mesa 3.5 is (will be) changed so that it
is more modular.  The motivation is better support of 3D hardware
such as T&L hardware in which much of core Mesa isn't needed.

Details to come...
