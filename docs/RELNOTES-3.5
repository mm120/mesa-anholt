                             Month ??, 2000

                             PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

The internal structure of Mesa 3.5 is (will be) changed so that it
is more modular.  The motivation is better support of 3D hardware
such as T&L hardware in which much of core Mesa isn't needed.

Details to come...



New Extensions
--------------

GL_EXT_convolution
	Adds image convolution to glRead/Copy/DrawPixels/TexImage.

GL_ARB_imaging
	This is the optional imaging subset of OpenGL 1.2.
	It's the GL_EXT_convolution, GL_HP_convolution_border_modes,
	GL_EXT_histogram, GL_EXT_color_table, GL_EXT_color_subtable
	GL_EXT_blend_color, GL_EXT_blend_minmax, GL_EXT_blend_subtract
	and GL_SGI_color_matrix extensions all rolled together.
	This is supported in all software renderers but not in all
	hardware drivers (3dfx for example).

GL_ARB_texture_compression
	This is supported in Mesa but only used by the 3dfx DRI drivers
	for Voodoo4 and later.

GL_NV_blend_square
	Adds extra blend source and dest factors which allow squaring
	of color values.
