Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Even numbered versions (such as 4.0) designate stable releases.
Odd numbered versions (such as 4.1) designate new developmental releases.


New Features in Mesa 4.1
------------------------

GL_NV_vertex_program

    NVIDIA's vertex programming extension

GL_ARB_window_pos

    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_MESA_window_pos

GL_ARB_depth_texture

    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_SGIX_depth_texture.
    It allows depth (Z buffer) data to be stored in textures.
    This is used by GL_ARB_shadow

GL_ARB_shadow
    Shadow mapping with depth textures.
    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_SGIX_shadow.

GL_ARB_shadow_ambient

    Allows one to specify the luminance of shadowed pixels.
    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_SGIX_shadow_ambient.



Device Driver Status
--------------------

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of these drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:


Driver			Status

OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.3
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.3
