                              Month day, 2003

                                PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Even-numbered versions (such as 5.0) designate stable releases.
Odd-numbered versions (such as 5.1) designate new developmental releases.


Bug fixes
---------
See the VERSIONS file for a list of bugs fixed in this release.



New Features in Mesa 5.1
------------------------

GL_ATI_texture_env_combine3 extension
   This adds a few new texture combine modes.
   Contributed by Ian Romanick.

GL_SGI_texture_color_table
   Adds a color table lookup to the RGBA texture path.  There's a separate
   color table for each texture unit.
   Contributed by Eric Plante.

GL_NV_fragment_program
   NVIDIA's fragment-level programming feature.



Source File Changes
-------------------

The mmath.[ch] files are obsolete.  Their contents have been moved
into the imports.[ch] and macros.[ch] files.

The files related to vertex and fragment programming have changed.
Old files:
	vpexec.[ch]
	vpparse.[ch]
	vpstate.[ch]
New files:
	nvvertprog.h              - NV vertex program definitions
	nvfragprog.h              - NV fragment program definitions
	nvvertparse.[ch]          - NV vertex program parser
	nvfragparse.[ch]          - NV fragment program parser
	nvprogram.[ch]            - NV program API functions
	nvvertexec.[ch]           - NV vertex program execution
	swrast/s_nvfragprog.[ch]  - NV fragment program execution

Removed files:
	swrast/s_historgram.[ch]	- moved into src/histogram.c



Device Driver Status
--------------------

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of these drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:


Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.4
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.4
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.4
DJGPP			implements OpenGL 1.4
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			needs updating (underway)
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating

Note: supporting OpenGL 1.4 (vs. 1.3 or 1.2) usually only requires that the
driver call the _mesa_enable_1_4_extensions() function.
