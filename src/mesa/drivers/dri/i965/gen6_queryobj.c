 * Support for query objects (GL_ARB_occlusion_query, GL_ARB_timer_query,
 * GL_EXT_transform_feedback, and friends) on platforms that support
 * hardware contexts (Gen6+).
 *
 * The query object gets the starting value of some counter written in the
 * first uint64_t of the query BO, and the end value written in the second
 * uint64_t.  Pipelined after that is a "1" field that gets written to the
 * next uint64_t, which indicates that the query has been completed (We don't
 * know for sure that the end value will be non-zero, and thus can't check it
 * to see if it's been written or not).
