/** @file brw_packed_floats_gen.c
 *
 * Used to generate the table of packed floats in brw_packed_floats.c, so it
 * doesn't have to be done at runtime.  See vol5c ("Execution Unit ISA") secton
 * 2.2.7 ("Packed 8-bit restricted float vector").
 *
 * Note that the documentation appears to be incorrect in its description of the
 * limits of the packed float format.  It says that the smallest representable
 * number is .125/-.125.  However, the values that would produce .125 and -.125
 * are special cased to be the +0/-0 values.  The actual smallest numbers are
 * 0.1328125 and -0.1328125 -- mantissa values of 1.
