Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Even-numbered versions (such as 5.0) designate stable releases.
Odd-numbered versions (such as 5.1) designate new developmental releases.


New Features in Mesa 5.1
------------------------

GL_ATI_texture_env_combine3 extension
   This adds a few new texture combine modes.

Device Driver Status
--------------------

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of these drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:


Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.4
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.4
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.4
DOS/DJGPP		implements OpenGL 1.3
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
DOS			implements OpenGL 1.4
BeOS			needs updating (underway)
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating

Note: supporting OpenGL 1.4 (vs. 1.3 or 1.2) usually only requires that the
driver call the _mesa_enable_1_4_extensions() function.
