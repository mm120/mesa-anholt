/** @file hash.c
 *
 * Simple open-addressed hash table implementation.  The table stores for
 * each entry:
 *
 * hash of the key.
 * pointer to the key.
 * pointer to the data.
 *
 * Inserts occur at key->hash % hash->size.  When an insert collides, the insert
 * reattempts at (key->ash % hash->size + hash->reprobe) % hash->size, and
 * onwards at increments of reprobe until a free or dead entry is found.
 *
 * When searching, the search starts at key % hash_size and continues at
 * increments of reprobe until the matching entry or an unallocated entry is
 * found.
 *
 * When deleting an entry, the entry is marked deleted.
 *
 * Performance considerations:
 * - Only an extra 10% free is given.
 * This means that as entries are added, the performance of insertion and
 * lookups will degrade as one approaches maximum entries until the table
 * gets resized.
 * - Repeated deletions fill the table with deleted entry markers.
 * This means that a table that was filled, then emptied, will have
 * performance for unsuccessful searches in O(hash->size)
 */

/*
 * From Knuth -- a good choice for hash/rehash values is p, p-2 where
 * p and p-2 are both prime.  These tables are sized to have an extra 10%
 * free to avoid exponential performance degradation as the hash table fills
