                            <month>, <day>, 2002

                               PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Even numbered versions (such as 4.0) designate stable releases.
Odd numbered versions (such as 4.1) designate new developmental releases.


New Features in Mesa 4.1
------------------------

New extensions.  Docs at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/

GL_NV_vertex_program

    NVIDIA's vertex programming extension

GL_NV_vertex_program1_1

    A few features built on top of GL_NV_vertex_program

GL_ARB_window_pos

    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_MESA_window_pos

GL_ARB_depth_texture

    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_SGIX_depth_texture.
    It allows depth (Z buffer) data to be stored in textures.
    This is used by GL_ARB_shadow

GL_ARB_shadow

    Shadow mapping with depth textures.
    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_SGIX_shadow.

GL_ARB_shadow_ambient

    Allows one to specify the luminance of shadowed pixels.
    This is the ARB-approved version of GL_SGIX_shadow_ambient.

GL_EXT_shadow_funcs

    Extends the set of GL_ARB_shadow texture comparision functions to
    include all eight of standard OpenGL dept-test functions.

GL_ARB_point_parameters

    This is basically the same as GL_EXT_point_parameters.



Device Driver Status
--------------------

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of these drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:


Driver			Status
----------------------	---------------------
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.3
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.3
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.3
DOS/DJGPP		implements OpenGL 1.3
GGI			needs updating
BeOS			needs updating
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating
DOS			needs updating




XXX Things To Do Yet XXXX
-------------------------

Verify x86 code for normal transformation works with new 4-element normal
vector arrays.  Pretty sure the SSE code is wrong.

Finish up NV_vertex_program support for evaluators.  Vertex arrays seem
to work as of 4/21/2002.

Move sw_span struct into swrast context instead of allocating it on
the stack.  Allow multiple points to be rendered into one sw_span.

Investigate the normal transformation bug when using non-uniform
scale matrices.

_tnl_end() has flushing forced on.

improve point/line rendering speed.

readpixels from stencil/z should respect ctx->ReadBuffer

glVertexAttrib*NV(index>15) should cause an error.

GL_ARB_texture_env_crossbar: Allows any texture combine stage to reference
any texture source unit
